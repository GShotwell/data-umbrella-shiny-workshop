The first step when starting a new shiny app is to set up a virtual environment. 
You should get in the habit of doing this with every project because it makes deployment much easier. 

```{.bash}
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Next we'll install the packages we'll be using for this presentation. 

```{.bash}
pip install shiny plotnine pandas
```
